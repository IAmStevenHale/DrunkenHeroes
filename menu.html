          Whoever can chug the fastest starts. If two or more people believe
          that their superpower is chugging, than a chug-off will be the
          decider.
          <br />
          <br />
          Draw a card and read it aloud (unless it says otherwise). Follow the
          instructions on the card and try to survive.
          <br />
          Some cards will be marked "SECRET" - do not read these ones out loud.
          <br />
          Some cards can be held until later on - try and remember!
          <br />
          There are rare cards that allow you to gain permenant superpowers -
          but at what cost?!
          <br />
          <br />
          The Winner is the last Hero standing... Seriously though, the winner
          is the person that can prove that they are the ultimate Drunken Hero
          by not passing out.
          <br />
          <br />
          Remember the aim is to have fun... who am I kidding, the aim is to
          win.
          <br />
          Crush your enemies <i>and</i> your friends!
